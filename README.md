# README.md-4
# 1.Python Operators
Operators refer to special symbols that perform operations on values and variables. The operands in python, one of the programming languages, refer to the values on which the operator operates.


# 2.Ternary Operator in Python
The ternary operator in Python is simply a shorter way of writing an if and if...else statements. 


# 3.Division Operators in Python
In Python, there are two types of division operators: / : Divides the number on its left by the number on its right and returns a floating point value. // : Divides the number on its left by the number on its right, rounds down the answer, and returns a whole number.


# 4.Operators Overloading in Python
Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because '+' operator is overloaded by int class and str class.


# 5.Any All in Python 
The Python any() and all() functions evaluate the items in a list to see which are true. The any() method returns true if any of the list items are true, and the all() function returns true if all the list items are true.


# 6.Operator Functions in Python | Set 1
The operator module exports a set of efficient functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python. For example, operator.add(x, y) is equivalent to the expression x+y . Many function names are those used for special methods, without the double underscores.


# 7.Operator Functions in Python | Set 2
Operator functions in Python are pre-defined functions that allow us to perform various operations on values or variables using operators. Operators are the symbols or special characters used to perform operations on operands. In Python, operators can be used to perform arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations.


# 8.Difference between == and is operator in Python
   # == operator
The “==” operator is known as the equality operator. The operator will return “true” if both the operands are equal.
   # is operator
The is keyword is used to test if two variables refer to the same object. The test returns True if the two objects are the same object. The test returns False if they are not the same object.


# 9.Python Membership and Identity Operators
Python. Membership Operators. Membership operators are operators used to validate the membership of a value. It test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples. in operator : The 'in' operator is used to check if a value exists in a sequence or not.


# 10.Python Data  | Set 3 (Strings, Lists, Tuples, Iterations 
   # Strings
In computer programming, a string is a sequence of characters. For example, "hello" is a string containing a sequence of characters 'h' , 'e' , 'l' , 'l' , and 'o' . We use single quotes or double quotes to represent a string in Python.  
   # Lists
A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item.  
   # Tuples
Tuple. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.    
   # Iterations 
Repetitive execution of the same block of code over and over is referred to as iteration. There are two types of iteration: Definite iteration, in which the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance. Indefinite iteration, in which the code block executes until some condition is met.
